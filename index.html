                    Gaius Julius Caesar (/ˈɡaɪəs ... ˈsiːzər/; Latin: [ˈɡaːiʊs ˈjuːliʊs ˈkae̯sar]; 
                    12 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), was a Roman general and statesman. A member of the 
                    First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his 
                    political rival Pompey in a civil war, and subsequently became dictator from 49 BC until his 
                    assassination in 44 BC. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of 
                    the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and 
                    Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance that dominated 
                    Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares <were class=""></were> opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, which greatly extended Roman territory. During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the Rhine river. These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. In 49 BC, Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army.[2] This began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near unchallenged power and influence in 45 BC.
