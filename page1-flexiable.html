                Ancient Egypt - THE Pharoah
            </h1>
                <p>
                    The Pharoah was a living god.  He was at the top of Ancient Egyptian society.  The pharoah
                    was responsible for the well being of his people and was obligated to keep the order. 
                    He was all powerful and he spent most of his time at the capital city of Memphis.  Here 
                    he administered control of both Lower and Upper Egypt.

                <p>
                    The Pharoah spent most of his life working on his tomb.  The Pharoah's had this busy afterlife
                    where they continued to control the universe after their death.  The god Anubis assisted
                    the pharoah in the mummfication process.  After the pharoah died he traveled to the underworld
                    using the Book of the Dead.
